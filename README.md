# TVseries-recommendation
This was a project for the course web technology in semester 6.

## Dataset
We are using this dataset to get a list of TV series.
https://www.kaggle.com/chasewillden/netflix-shows

## Recommendation:
We are using Recombee API for the recommendation system. 

## Scripts
- ```csv_reader.py``` : Reads the CSV file and add TV Series objects into the database and for demo purposes we created new user and rating objects in the same script.
- ```send_data.py``` : Sends the ratings objects to the Recombee API for initial demo purposes.

## TO DO:
- Google OAuth in login and register
- API that returns images when name of TV Series is passed( Currently it is hardcoded to FRIENDS)
- Edit button to change percentage on Watchlist page.
- Currently API only takes ratings but we would like to take genres and stuff as well.
